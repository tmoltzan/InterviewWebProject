# InterviewWebProject

Introduction: I chose to do this project using the Angular CLI and VS Code. In the last few weeks I had been working through the tutorials on anuglar.io and there is significant overlap between the "Homes" tutorial and the requirements for this project. My VS Code set up, Angular CLI, Node version, etc were all configured and known to be working.

Requirements to run the project:
This project is built using the following versions, other versions may work but testing version compatibility is out of scope:
VS Code 1.85.1
Node 20.11.0
Windows 10 PC
Chrome 120.0.6099.217
Angular CLI
TypeScript 4.9.5
